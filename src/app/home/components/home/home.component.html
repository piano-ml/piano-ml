          Learning Piano require a strong personal investment.<br>
          It is a long and difficult process.<br>
          The best piano learning app can't replace a real piano teacher. Using an app is not enough to learn piano and can lead you to bad
          habits.<br>
          That said practice is good. <br>
          Practicing scale is one of the best way to learn Piano and this is why we built
          PianoML.<br>
          Each week a new scale to be practiced every day, according to a set of different exercises.
          Don't forget to always use a metronome when practicing.<br>
          We also wanted a tool that could load any Midi File as you can find them easily on the world wide web<br>

        <p class="text-xl mb-4 text-justify">
          By opening a MIDI file, you can choose one or two tracks to be transcribed into a Grand Staff score, with the option for hand separation.

      <p class="text-xl mb-4 text-justify">
        PianoML is a web application that run on your browser. There is no server. Thus we do not require you to get an
        account to run the app. All what you need is a web browser plugged to your Midi Keyboard.<br>
      </p>


      <p class="text-xl mb-4 text-justify">
        By making the software open source, we want to give the opportunity to anyone to contribute to the project
        and make piano learning more accessible to a wider audience.

      <p class="text-xl mb-4 text-justify">
