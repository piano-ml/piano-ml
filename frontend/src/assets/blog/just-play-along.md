# PianoML Introduces MIDI Accompaniment Feature: Elevate Your Practice Experience



PianoML, the innovative piano learning app, is thrilled to announce a powerful new feature that takes your practice sessions to the next level. 

PianoML now lets you play with accompaniment, adding rhythm, chords, and other instruments from a MIDI file while you practice. The classic play-along feature, with wait-for-play guidance, remains, but now you can enjoy a richer sound as you play!



Now, starting from a MIDI file, PianoML can play rich, dynamic accompaniments, including rhythm, backing instruments, and more, to enhance your playing experience.

This new capability allows users to upload a MIDI file and instantly create a fuller, more immersive musical arrangement. Whether you're practicing a solo piece or jamming along, the accompaniment feature adds layers of rhythm, chords, and other instruments, transforming your practice into a vibrant, band-like experience.

The beloved legacy feature—play-along with wait-for-play functionality—remains intact, ensuring that learners can still practice at their own pace with guided feedback. Now, with the addition of customizable accompaniments, you can enjoy a richer soundscape while honing your skills. 

Listen to the rhythm section, orchestral backing, or any combination of instruments as you play, making every session more engaging and inspiring.Stay tuned for more updates as PianoML continues to evolve, bringing you closer to mastering the piano with creativity and confidence!
